Hey! Welcome to my website.

I'm a Research Associate in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. My research interests include Deep Learning, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and Geospatial Analytics. In my spare time I enjoy art, swimming, hiking and cooking.

This is my personal little nerd cave. I like to share the work I do on my blog. I hope you find something useful here!
