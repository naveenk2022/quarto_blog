        "\n",
        "A basic Ansible environment has the following three components:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Control Node**: This is a system on which Ansible is installed, and the system from which Ansible commands such as `ansible-inventory` are issued. This is also where Ansible playbooks and configuration files are stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Managed node**: This is a remote system that Ansible intends to manage and configure.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Inventory**: This is a list of managed nodes that are organized locally on the **control node**. This lists the IP addresses or the hostnames of the remote systems being managed along with any connection information needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ansible uses a declarative language in the YAML format to describe the *desired end state* of the managed nodes, and it can connect to these managed nodes via standard protocols like SSH and handle the execution of the tasks required to acheive this end state. These are done via YAML-based files called **Playbooks**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Playbooks** are automation blueprints, in the `YAML` format. Playbooks contain **plays**, which are a list of tasks that map to each managed node in the predefined inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tasks** are a list of one or more modules that define the operations that Ansible can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Module** is a unit of code that Ansible can run on managed nodes.\n",

        "\n",
        "The key features of Ansible that make it deal to perform automated configuration management of remote systems are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Agentless Architecture**: Ansible only needs to be installed on the Control Node, and the Managed nodes do not require Ansible to be installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Idempotent Execution**: Ansible ensures that no matter how many time the same Playbook is run, the end state of the managed nodes will be the same, regardless of the initial state of the managed node.\n",
