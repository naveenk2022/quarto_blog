        "pgBackRest is an open source tool that allows you to perform automated backup and restore operations for a PostgreSQL server. It allows you to take both full and incremental file system backups of your data. With pgBackRest, you can set up multiple repositories for your backups, both local and remote. You can further customize the configuration to take backups at specific times of the day so that regular operations are not affected, and backup retention and rotation can be customized as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, it allows mirroring of backups to cloud-compatible object stores, including S3, Azure, and GCS compatible object stores.\n",

        "nsecurely configured SFTP backups can expose critical database content to unauthorized access, yet many organizations rely on them for off-site storage. This guide addresses the security gap and will explain the process of setting up remote SFTP repositories in a secure manner. We will create a system user on the SFTP repository and limit their permissions, and perform scheduled backups exclusively via the limited user account. \n",
        "\n",
        "A good database backup strategy uses multiple repositories of different types, alongside both physical and logical backups. Do not limit yourself to merely SFTP repositories. Remember, with database backups, redundancy is good. This tutorial is simply to explain how to *securely* configure SFTP backups. \n",
